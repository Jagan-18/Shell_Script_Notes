### Explanation:
#### 1. SOURCE_DIR: The directory you want to back up (/var/log/ in your example).
#### 2. DEST_DIR: The directory where the backup will be stored. Replace /path/to/backup/directory with the actual path.
#### 3. TIMESTAMP: The date command generates a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS which is appended to the backup filename to ensure itâ€™s unique.
#### 4. tar -czf: This command creates a compressed .tar.gz archive.
####       -c: Create a new archive.
####       -z: Compress the archive with gzip.
####       -f: Use the filename provided ($BACKUP_FILENAME).

####       -C: Change to the directory (/var/log) before creating the backup (so the paths inside the archive aren't absolute).
